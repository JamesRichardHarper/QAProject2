Hello {0},

It appears you put "{1}" as your subject heading. Unfortunetly this isn't a viable option within our system.

To create an account use "CREATE".
To edit an account use "CHANGE" and submit a new creation table with your unique ID appended to the row, with the ID in the corresponding box.
To delete your account use "DELETE" and submit your unique ID in a table form similar to how the account was created.
